A project to set experiment with using speech-to-text for controlling a linux workstation

## Directory structure

- keyboard/ - demo of sending input events to virtual keyboard using `uinput` device
- speech-streamer - a rust application to stream utterances recognized from mic input

## Contributing and project status

This project is in a prototype stage and may never gain useful features. 
The goal is to be able to provide a degree of useful voice control for a
linux workstation. 

You're welcome to use the code as-is, and I'll be happy to accept pull requests
that move the project forward in that direction - but it's currently just a
hobby project so of course I won't be able to provide support or bugfixes in
the traditional sense. If it's useful to you, then I'd love to hear about it.
